We proposed a image pixel Mapping technique and integrating it with two axis gantry
robot frame to detect plant weed position and precisely spray pesticides. This entire
process is automated with the help of Microprocessor.The outcome of the project is a 
weed detection and spraying mechanism which, when incorporated onto a gantry robot, is
capable of moving in the Cartesian direction to detect the Plant weed in the area of
interest and spray pesticides based on requirement.
